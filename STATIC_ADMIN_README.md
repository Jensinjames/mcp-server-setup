# MCP Static Admin Console

This is a static HTML version of the MCP Admin Console that can be viewed directly in a browser without running a server.

## Viewing the Static Admin Console

To view the static admin console, simply open the `public/admin.html` file in your web browser:

1. Navigate to the project directory

Alternatively, you can use any simple HTTP server to serve the file:

cd public
python -m http.server 3001

# Or using Node.js http-server (if installed)
cd public
npx http-server -p 3001
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3001/admin.html
```
